a = []
An array is an object of the Array class.
Creating an array is making an instance of the array class.

Assigning it to a variable allows Ruby to hold on to it.

Classes review
Array (Array.new)
Nil*
True*
False*
String (String.new)
Hash (Hash.new)
Fixnum
*there is only ever one instance of these classes

@ means an instance variable
Instance variable - allows values to be stored outside of functions. We want these varibles to stay with the object.

Instance vaiables are private - you cannot access them unless it allows you to. To do this you have to use a funtion to create a method of that object (line 8 bank_account.rb)

Local variables - live for the life of the function then die.
